        <p>
          I am a full-stack developer who is committed to using software to
          improve people’s lives. My background in social history taught me
          effective communication and research skills, and my experience in the
          nonprofit world trained me to value thriftiness, collaboration, and
          creativity. I’m seeking a front-end or full-stack role at a company
          that values creative thinking and teamwork.
